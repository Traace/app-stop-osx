			<p>App Stop is a powerful application engineered to allow you to take control of the applications running on your computer allowing you to increase the speed of your computer.
			App Stop allows you to peform many operations on your applications such as pausing, setting processor priority, and force quitting. App Stop is great for people with slower computers, or for people who run processor hungry applications (such as video editors), who need to squeeze every ounce of speed out of their computer.

			App Stop is compromised of two main parts: the menu-item's drop-down menu, and the application manager</p>

						<p>All of us Mac users have many applications open at one time. Having alot of applications open at once doesn't mean you have to sacrifice speed. App Stop allows you to pause applications, which essentially freezes them in time until they are resumed.</p>
