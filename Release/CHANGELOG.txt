-Improved 'hide and stop' reliability
-Your filter criteria will now be preserved between App Stop startups
-Totally rewrote the 'startup at login' code

-Major memory usage enhancements 
-Minor performance enhancements

11/13/06- V2.0
[FEATURES]
-App Stop now works on Intel Macs!
-Added ability to exclude zombie processes from the application manager
-Added "Update Application List" action
-Added automatic self-updating using the Sparkle framework
-Added ability to bring App Stop to the front by cmd+clicking on the menu-item
-Fully rewritten documentation/help files
-cmd+F now jumps to the search field in the application manager

[BUGFIXES]
-Fixed a couple issues with the application filtering/searching mechanism
-Fixed bug where CPU column sorting would not work correctly
-Fixed a bunch of memory leaks
-CPU column will now remain sorted and will not jump to the selected application when the CPU usage is updated
-Significantly reduced memory usage
-App Stop will no longer report -1% CPU usage for any application
-The CPU usage reporting for kernel_task is now correct

[IMPROVEMENTS]
-Redesigned preference panel
-Reorganized system-wide drop down menu
-Replaced buttons on bottom-left side of table with action menu
-Drastically improved error checking and error reporting
-Switched from using named pipes for interprocess communication to unnamed pipes (this fixed a couple crashes that were occurring)
-Improved core communication algorithm. This greatly improves the overall performance of App Stop, some operations (such as CPU usage polling, and background process polling) are 2-5x faster than before!
-Improved the response and reliability of changing polling related preferences (background process polling, and CPU usage polling)

02/08/11-V1.1
-Rewrote the cpu usage code, its now much cleaner
-Force quitting background applications will remove them from the list immediately
-iTunes-like live searching ability added
-App Stop is now a universal binary
-Updated to Xcode 2.2, compiling with the latest GCC release

09/09/05-V1.0
-Added right click menu to the table view
-Fixed bug where after the computer goes to sleep, the menu icon will not change to represent if their is a paused application
-Added option to use a black menu icon set
-Combined the image & name columns in the table view
-Rewrote outputting from authnice so integers are directly outputted, instead of being converted back and forth between C strings
-App Stop now requires that you successfully authorize yourself, or app stop will terminate
-App Stop is now multi-account safe
-Added 'App Stop Help' menu item
-Some UI clean-up/polishing
-Made a workaround for the weird crashing bug on 10.3, you now have to restart App Stop for preference changes in the 'Background Processes' tab to take effect
-Greatly improved help/documentation

08/26/05-V1.0b
-Fixed a bug where applications that should be in the menu bar item's menu, weren't
-Upgraded AGProcess to .5, which fixed a few small bugs that were occurring
-Some small speed optimizations
-I rewrote the background-application update performing, ands its much faster using much less CPU when checking for background-applications
-Fixed a bug where your selection on the table view would change to the newly added application
-Totally rewrote the helper application which handled performing actions on root and other applications not running on the current UID.
This improvement brings the following features and enhancements:
	-Ability to retrieve CPU usage of other processes running under different UID's than the current UID
	-Ability to pause/resume processes running under different UID's the current UID
	-Ability to force quit processes running under different UID's the current UID
	-Faster performance for renicing applications running under different UID's the current UID

-Added the much requested support for background applications
-Added a UID/User-name column to the table-view
-Fixed problem where the menu icon would be really small on OS X 10.3
-Fixed a problem where checking for updated while disconnected from the internet would report than a new version is available
